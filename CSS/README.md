# CSS

## Section 1: [Basics, Selectors and Specificity](https://codepen.io/b-renz/full/rNdvqWO)
*Focus:*
1. Background and text properties and colors
2. ID, class and descendant selectors
3. pseudo classes and specificity

**Accomplished:**
- Changed font, background color, and link decoration
- Formatted and styled header form and button, as well as tables
- Added google maps image and employee profile pictures
- Created box shadows to separate sections

*Toughts?*
Pretty basic intro to CSS, looking forward to working more with containers 
and hide/unhide features. All-in-all, pretty noticeable difference given the 
simplicity of this section.
