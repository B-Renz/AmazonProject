# Udemy-WebDev

**Just documenting my journey** 
[https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

This course is divided into multiple sections that require progressions of skillset from the previous lesson in order to move forward into the next lesson.
Although the lessons are worth documenting themselves, this repository is mainly focused on one project and how that project was used to exemplify the progression of skillsets needed to continue moving forward in this course. 

**Project: Visualize Inventory Tracking and Asset Management for a Distribution Warehouse**

Each Section quickly summarizes the scope of the lesson to get a better understanding of each phase in the project:
- HTML, The Essentials
- HTML, Semantics
- HTML, Forms and Tables
- CSS, Basics
- CSS, Selectors
- CSS, Box Model
- CSS, Advanced Properties
- CSS, Responsive and Flex Box
- CSS, Frameworks and Bootstrap
