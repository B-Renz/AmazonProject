# Udemy-WebDev

**Just documenting my journey** <br/>
[https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) <br/>

This course is divided into multiple sections that require progressions of skillset from the previous lesson in order to move forward into the next lesson.<br/>
Although the lessons are worth documenting themselves, this repository is mainly focused on one project and how that project was used to exemplify the progression of skillsets needed to continue moving forward in this course. <br/>

## Project: Visualize Inventory Tracking and Asset Management for a Distribution Warehouse <br/>

**Data Model for the project*** <br/>
I felt like a non-linear approach to our data structure would serve us best if we are to attempt a NoSQL architecture utillizing MongoDB and JSON parameters <br/>

I felt like a divide and conquor strategy would be best for the architecture of this database model, so I went with a Binary Search Tree (BST) and designed it as balanced.

**I'll continue to build on this as I progress into this project, even though this is not part of any lesson within the Udemy WebDev course*
