# HTML

## Section 1: [The Essentials](https://codepen.io/b-renz/full/rNdwYPG)
*Focus:*
1. Headings and Paragraph Elements
2. Ordered and Unordered Lists
3. Anchor Tags and Links

**Accomplished:**
- Utilized H1, H2, H3 and H4 within html file
- Nested Unordered-lists within other unordered lists, and nested those in an ordered list
- Utilized a paragraph element to identify site id 
- Nested an anchor tag with a link to google maps within a paragraph element to identify site location

**Thoughts?**
	*Basic but expected. Simplicity of it is nice though... feels succinct.* 
	*Needs callapsable/expandable feature on list-items*
