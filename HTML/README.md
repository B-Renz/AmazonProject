# HTML

## Section 1: [The Essentials](https://codepen.io/b-renz/full/rNdwYPG)
*Focus:*
1. Headings and Paragraph Elements
2. Ordered and Unordered Lists
3. Anchor Tags and Links

**Accomplished:**
- Utilized H1, H2, H3 and H4 within html file
- Nested Unordered-lists within other unordered lists, and nested those in an ordered list
- Utilized a paragraph element to identify site id 
- Nested an anchor tag with a link to google maps within a paragraph element to identify site location

**Thoughts?**
	*Basic but expected. Simplicity of it is nice though... feels succinct.* 
	*Needs callapsable/expandable feature on list-items* 
  
## Section 2: [Semantics](https://codepen.io/b-renz/full/YzarGbm)
*Focus:*
1. Divs and Spans (block vs. inline elements)
2. Superscripts/Subscripts and Code Entities
3. Semantic Markup and Accessibility 

**Accomplished**
- Created a header and footer element and nested a nav element within the header element
- Deleted Ordered List to include nav list items [Infrastructure, Devices, Clean-Up]
- Created Sections in <main> element [Infrastructure, Devices, Clean-Up]
- Added alt text to each anchor element
- Created span and div elements to encapsulate data groups within each <main> element
- Tested webpage with Orca gnome screen reader to ensure accuracy and accessibility

**Thoughts?**
	*None*
